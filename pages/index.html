                <p>The Japan Racing Association (Japanese: 日本中央競馬会 Nippon Chūō Keiba Kai
                    , or JRA) is a public company established in Japan under a law to operate 
                    Chūō Keiba (中央競馬 Central horse racing) and to manage racecourses, betting 
                    facilities, and horse-training facilities in the country. 
                    It was founded in[1] 1954, according to the Horse Racing Law 
                    (競馬法 Keiba Hō) and the Japan Racing Association Law (日本中央競馬会法 Nippon Chūō Keiba Kai Hō)

                    Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the President & CEO of JRA, has been in place since 2007.
                     The Board of Governors sets key operation items such as JRA's basic management policies 
                     and makes final decisions on budgets and business planning. It is also involved 
                     in supervising the duties of executives. The Management Advisory Council assists 
                     the President & CEO, consisting of 10 members drawn from owners, trainers, jockeys 
                     and academics appointed by the President & CEO, with the approval of the Minister. 
                     It reviews and discusses items of importance to the business management of JRA.
                     The Horseracing Adjudication Council meets for official deliberations on the registration of owners, 
                     licensing of trainers and jockeys, and appeals filed against 
                     racing decisions under the Law of Administrative Tribunals.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="text-container">
                <p>The origins of horse racing in Japan date back to the 8th century. Initially conducted as a ritual for the Imperial Court, the practice grew in popularity and expanded across the nation, becoming a common event at many major religious sites.</p>
                <p>These competitions, which involved samurai, gained a significant following among the general populace and were commonly documented in the period's historical records and literary works. An annual race at Kyoto's Kamigamo Shrine every May is a direct continuation of this tradition, preserving styles and customs from the 11th century throughout Japan's aristocratic and feudal periods for over 900 years.</p>
                <p>As Japan transitioned from its feudal system during the Meiji Restoration in 1862, Western-style horse racing was introduced by foreign residents, mainly British, living in Yokohama, who founded the Yokohama Race Club.</p>
                <p>This early period of modern, Western-influenced racing occurred primarily within foreign communities, leaving few records and making its initial history in Japan somewhat obscure. Around the time the capital was renamed from Edo to Tokyo, this style of racing started to appear in major urban centers nationwide.</p>
                <p>A significant shift occurred in 1906 when government policy began to tacitly permit betting. This led to the establishment of modern pari-mutuel racing in cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka, which proved financially beneficial for most race organizers. This profitable system was brief; betting was banned just two years later, replaced by a system of direct government subsidies for prize money and operational costs.</p>
                <p>During this era of subsidized racing, influential figures from politics, business, and breeding circles campaigned for dedicated horse racing legislation. The government, aiming to enhance domestic horse breeding and quality, eventually took a proactive role. This culminated in the 1923 Horse Racing Law, which authorized legal betting and led to the creation of 11 racing clubs.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, the Imperial Racing Society was formed to oversee these clubs, standardizing regulations and managing functions like the registration of racing colors and the licensing of trainers and jockeys.</p>
                <p>A major reform in 1936 consolidated the 11 clubs and the Imperial Racing Society into a single entity, the Japan Racing Society. This merger of assets and functions brought significant advancements, including the creation of premier JRA classic races such as the Japanese Derby. This period saw a substantial rise in betting turnover and attendance, marking the true beginning of modern Japanese horse racing as it is recognized today.</p>
                <p>During World War II, racecourses were forced to close, with the historic Yokohama track being commandeered for military use. Racing resumed quickly after the war, with meetings held in Tokyo and Kyoto in 1946. A new form of betting, the Quinella, was introduced in 1947.</p>
                <p>The following year, a new Horse Racing Law abolished the Japan Racing Society and placed the sport under the complete control of the national government, specifically the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.</p>
                <p>Although this "government racing" continued operations, it struggled to increase turnover during a challenging economic period. The Horse Racing Law was amended again in 1954, establishing the Japan Racing Association (JRA) via the Japan Racing Association Law. The JRA took over all functions from the government system.</p>
                <p>This legislation also formally recognized and regulated a separate system for regional public racing alongside the national racing framework.</p>
